# Clinical_Note_Exploration
LLM-powered Semantic Information Retrieval in Clinical Notes with RAG using llama-index 
## Project Description
This data science project involves using the llamaindex SDK, which is a software development kit, to interface with large language models (LLMs) and associated tools in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. The goal is to perform vector search on clinical notes using open-source vector databases. 
This project aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval from clinical notes, potentially aiding medical professionals in diagnosis, treatment planning, and research.
By using LLMs and vector search, the system can go beyond simple keyword matching and capture the nuances of language used in the medical domain.Here's a brief explanation of the key components and concepts mentioned in the description:
### llamaindex SDK: 
This is a software development kit (SDK) that provides tools and functionalities for interfacing with large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. It likely offers APIs and utilities for tasks such as querying, generating text, and managing interactions with LLMs.

### Large Language Models (LLMs): 
These are sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data and are capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Examples include GPT-3, BERT, and XLNet.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: 
RAG systems combine retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to natural language processing. They use both pre-existing knowledge (retrieval) and generation of new text to produce responses or generate content. This hybrid approach is particularly useful for tasks such as question answering and content generation.

### Vector Search:
Vector search involves representing text documents as vectors (numeric representations) in a high-dimensional space, where similar documents have vectors that are close together. It allows for efficient searching and retrieval of documents based on their similarity to a query.

### Clinical Notes:
These are textual records of patient encounters in healthcare settings, typically containing information about medical history, symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and other relevant clinical information.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER): 
NER is a task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying named entities (such as people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) mentioned in text. In this project, NER is likely used to identify specific entities or segments within clinical notes that are relevant to the search query.

## purpose of each of the listed libraries and packages:

'llama-index:' This library, mentioned multiple times in the requirements file, is likely a Python SDK (Software Development Kit) that provides tools and utilities for interfacing with large language models (LLMs) and associated tools in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. It may offer functionalities for querying, generating text, and managing interactions with LLMs.

langchain: This library's purpose isn't explicitly clear from its name alone, but it might be related to handling language processing tasks, given its similarity to other language-related libraries listed. It may provide functionalities for language processing, text analysis, or natural language understanding.

psycopg2-binary: This is a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It allows Python code to interact with PostgreSQL databases, enabling tasks such as connecting to databases, executing SQL queries, and fetching results.

sqlalchemy==1.4.51: SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. It provides a set of high-level abstractions for interacting with SQL databases in Python, allowing developers to work with databases using Python objects and expressions rather than writing raw SQL queries.

llmlingua: This library seems to be related to language processing or linguistics, given its name. It may provide functionalities for linguistic analysis, language modeling, or text processing tasks.

unstructured: The purpose of this library isn't immediately apparent from its name alone. It might be related to handling unstructured data or performing tasks on data that doesn't have a predefined schema or format.
